```python
def _get_cache_key(args):  
    frame = inspect.currentframe()  
    calling_func = inspect.getouterframes(frame)[1].function  
    return calling_func + str(args) + __version__
```

This function is using the `inspect` module to get information about the current call stack. 

The `inspect.currentframe()` function returns the current execution frame, and `inspect.getouterframes(frame)` returns a list of records for a frame and all higher (calling) frames. 

The function is getting the name of the function that called the current function by accessing the `function` attribute of the second item in the returned list (`inspect.getouterframes(frame)[1].function`). 

It then concatenates that function name with the string representation of the `args` argument and the value of the `__version__` variable to create a cache key. 

This key can be used to store and retrieve the result of the function for the given arguments in a cache.

"get information about the current call stack."这是什么意思？什么是 "current call stack"？可否举个例子说明？“current execution frame”是什么意思？什么是“farme in python”请举个例子说明。

In computer programming, a call stack is a data structure that stores information about the active subroutines of a program. Each time a function is called, a new frame is added to the top of the stack, and each time a function returns, its frame is removed from the top of the stack. The current call stack refers to the current state of the stack at a given point in time during the execution of a program.

For example, imagine you have the following program:

```python
def func1():
    print("in func1")
    func2()

def func2():
    print("in func2")
    func3()

def func3():
    print("in func3")

func1()

```

When the program runs, it will call `func1()`, which will call `func2()`, which in turn will call `func3()`. At the point that `func3()` is called, the call stack will contain the frames for `func1()`, `func2()`, and `func3()` in that order, with `func3()` at the top.

A frame in Python is a block of memory that stores the local variables, the instruction pointer and other information about a function call. For example, consider the following program,


```python
def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

greet("Alice")
```

When the program runs and calls the `greet("Alice")` function, Python creates a new frame that contains the local variables for the `greet()` function, including the `name` argument. This frame is added to the call stack, and it is removed from the stack when the function returns.

The current execution frame refers to the frame that is currently being executed, or the frame at the top of the call stack.
