pool.starmap

`Pool.starmap()` is a method of the `multiprocessing.Pool` class in Python that allows you to execute a function in parallel on multiple input sets. It is similar to the `map()` method, but it allows you to pass multiple arguments to the function using the `*args` syntax.

The `starmap()` method takes two arguments: the function to be executed in parallel and an iterable containing the input sets. Each input set should be represented as a tuple, with the elements of the tuple corresponding to the arguments of the function.

For example, consider a function that takes two arguments:

```python
def my_function(a, b):
    return a * b

with Pool(4) as p:
    input_sets = [(2, 3), (4, 5), (6, 7), (8, 9)]
    results = p.starmap(my_function, input_sets)
    print(results)

```

The above code will create a pool with 4 worker processes and use them to execute the `my_function` with each set of input in parallel, where each set of input is a tuple (2,3), (4,5), (6,7) and (8,9) respectively, and returns the output.

It is important to note that `Pool.starmap()` is only available in Python 3.3 and later versions.
