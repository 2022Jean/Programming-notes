#requests 库是如何构造请求并获得相应的？借助其他什么库了吗？

The `requests` library in Python is used for making HTTP requests to a specified URL. You can use the `get()` or `post()` method to send a GET or POST request respectively, and the library will return a response object that you can then use to access the server's response. The `requests` library does not rely on any other libraries to make HTTP requests, it uses the built-in `urllib3` library in Python to handle the underlying connection and data transfer.

requests 库在哪里使用了 urllib3 库？请说明它的具体位置并给出代码。

`requests` library uses `urllib3` internally to handle the underlying network connection and data transfer. When you make an HTTP request using `requests`, it will use `urllib3` to open a connection to the server, send the request, and receive the response. The specific location where `urllib3` is used within the `requests` library is in the `requests.packages.urllib3` package.

Here is an example of how `requests` library uses `urllib3` in the `get()` method:

```
Copy codeimport requests
response = requests.get('https://api.example.com')

```

When you call the `get()` method on the `requests` module, it uses `urllib3` to open a connection to the specified URL, send the GET request and receive the response.

requests 库的源码中哪里使用了 urllib3 库？

The `requests` library uses the `urllib3` library in several places throughout its codebase. Some of the key locations include:

1.  The `Session` class, which is the primary interface for making requests in `requests`. This class uses `urllib3` to handle the underlying connection pooling and connection reuse. You can see the code in the following link: [https://github.com/psf/requests/blob/main/requests/sessions.py#L323](https://github.com/psf/requests/blob/main/requests/sessions.py#L323)
    
2.  The `Adapter` classes, which are used to handle different types of connections and requests. For example, the `HTTPAdapter` class uses `urllib3` to handle regular HTTP requests and the `HTTPSAdapter` class uses `urllib3` to handle HTTPS requests. You can see the code in the following link: [https://github.com/psf/requests/blob/main/requests/adapters.py#L456](https://github.com/psf/requests/blob/main/requests/adapters.py#L456)
    
3.  The `Session.send()` method, which is responsible for sending a request and receiving a response from the server. This method uses `urllib3` to open a connection, send the request and receive the response. You can see the code in the following link: [https://github.com/psf/requests/blob/main/requests/sessions.py#L638](https://github.com/psf/requests/blob/main/requests/sessions.py#L638)
    
4.  The `Session.request()` method, which is a higher-level interface for making a request. This method uses `Session.send()` method and other methods to build the request, and then uses `urllib3` to send it and receive the response. You can see the code in the following link: [https://github.com/psf/requests/blob/main/requests/sessions.py#L527](https://github.com/psf/requests/blob/main/requests/sessions.py#L527)
    

It's worth noting that `requests` use `urllib3` as a low-level library to handle the underlying connection and data transfer, it abstracts it away in a high-level interface.
